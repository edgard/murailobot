## User Profiling System

MurailoBot includes a sophisticated user profiling system that:

- Automatically analyzes message patterns and content to build psychological profiles
- Maintains user information including aliases, locations, age ranges, and personality traits
- Preserves profile data between sessions and incrementally builds understanding
- Enhances AI responses with contextual user information
- Supports manual profile editing by administrators

The profiling system gathers insights by analyzing:
- Language patterns and word choice
- Emotional expressions and communication style
- Recurring themes in communications
- Cultural references and personal details
- Group interaction dynamics

## Release Process

This project uses an automated release workflow. Here's how it works:

### Automated Releases

When code is pushed to the `master` branch, the following happens automatically:

1. The CI workflow validates the code with tests and linting
2. Version is automatically bumped based on commit messages:
   - `fix:` or `fix(scope):` â†’ patch bump
   - `feat:` or `feat(scope):` â†’ minor bump
   - `BREAKING CHANGE:` in commit body â†’ major bump
3. A new git tag is created with the new version
4. A GitHub release is generated with release notes
5. Binary artifacts are built for multiple platforms
6. Docker images are built and pushed to GitHub Container Registry

### For Contributors

- No need to manually create version tags or releases
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for your commit messages
- The release type (patch, minor, major) is determined by your commit messages

All releases are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/edgard/murailobot/releases) page.
