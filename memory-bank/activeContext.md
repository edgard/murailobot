- Gemini Prompt Refinement:
  - Updated `MentionSystemInstructionHeader` to include a capabilities list (conversational assistant, admin commands, user profile analysis, image analysis, task scheduling, database operations), accept bot name and username as format parameters, and explicitly instruct the model _not_ to mimic the input message format (timestamp/UID prefix) in its replies.
  - Detailed `ProfileAnalyzerSystemInstruction` with guidelines for preserving existing profile data, specific quality requirements for traits (brevity, max 15-20 traits, no redundancy, aggressive consolidation, prioritization of personality traits, use of simple terms, avoidance of weak observations), and illustrative examples of good/bad trait formatting.
- Bot Info Retrieval: Implemented runtime retrieval of bot information (`GetMe`) and storage within the configuration struct.
- Removed deprecated methods `GetRecentMessagesInChat`, `DeleteAllMessages`, and `DeleteAllUserProfiles` from `internal/database/store.go`.
- Systematically analyzed all Go files (`cmd/`, `internal/`, `migrations/`) for dead code. No further dead code was identified.

**Next Steps**

- Implement comprehensive unit tests for scheduler, mention handler, transaction logic, middleware, and profile analysis logic.
- Add integration tests for the bot orchestrator and component interactions.
- Update `README.md` and other documentation to reflect recent changes (scheduler, commands, features).
- Dockerize the application and set up a CI/CD workflow (GitHub Actions based on README).
- Create helper CLI scripts for development tasks (e.g., seeding, resetting state).
- Improve user feedback for administrative operations.
- Add telemetry/monitoring for AI operation performance.
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for AI service resilience.
- Consider implementing pagination for large profile datasets (`/mrl_profiles`).
- Optimize message processing batch sizes for improved throughput.
- Explore database connection pooling improvements.
- Awaiting further instructions or tasks.

**Active Decisions & Considerations**

- Use built-in validators from go-playground/validator when available instead of custom implementations
- Provide sensible defaults for all configuration options while maintaining validation
- Use gocron v2 for all scheduled task management for better reliability
- Implement consistent context timeout handling across all long-running operations
- Provide detailed logging of scheduled task execution and performance
- Use standardized error handling patterns with proper error wrapping
- Ensure all components have proper shutdown procedures
- Maintain consistent terminology aligned with the Telegram API (chat_id instead of group_id)
- Use properly managed database transactions for related operations to ensure atomicity
- Provide detailed error information in logs while keeping user-facing messages simple
- Apply appropriate middleware to protect sensitive operations
- Standardize error handling patterns across all handlers
- Apply context timeouts to all AI operations with appropriate duration settings
- Implement partial success handling for batch operations rather than all-or-nothing
- Use statistical reporting for complex operations (processed/saved counts)
- Prefer explicit cancellation and timeout handling over generic error checks
- Ensure AI responses do not include the input message formatting prefixes (timestamp/UID).
- Enrich configuration at runtime where necessary (e.g., BotInfo from `GetMe`).
- AI Prompting: Explicitly instruct the model on desired output formatting, including what _not_ to include (e.g., input prefixes). Ensure `MentionSystemInstructionHeader` is parameterized for bot identity. Enforce strict content and formatting guidelines for `ProfileAnalyzerSystemInstruction` including data preservation and trait quality.
- The codebase is now leaner after the removal of unused database methods. The systematic check confirms no other obvious dead code.

**Important Patterns & Preferences**

- Configuration: Prefer built-in validators and provide sensible defaults for all options
- Scheduler Management: Use gocron v2's job API for registration and NewTask for execution
- Context Management: Propagate context through all operations with proper timeout handling
- Error Handling: Use structured logging with context and appropriate severity levels
- Component Lifecycle: Use errgroup for concurrent component management with proper shutdown
- Resource Management: Ensure all resources are properly released during shutdown
- Terminology: Use 'chat_id' consistently across code, database, and logs to match Telegram's terminology
- Transaction Management: Use defer tx.Rollback() pattern with explicit commit and nil assignment
- Middleware Application: Apply middleware in reverse order with the first in the slice being outermost
- Handler Organization: Use factory functions (newXHandler) for consistent initialization
- AI Operations: Implement context-aware timeouts with appropriate duration for profile analysis
- Batch Processing: Include detailed statistics (processed/saved counts) in logs and responses
- Error Recovery: Implement graceful degradation with partial success handling in batch operations
- Concurrency Management: Use proper timeout contexts for long-running operations with clear duration
- AI Prompting: Explicitly instruct the model on desired output formatting, including what _not_ to include (e.g., input prefixes). Parameterize `MentionSystemInstructionHeader` for bot identity. Apply strict guidelines for `ProfileAnalyzerSystemInstruction` regarding data preservation and trait quality (brevity, max traits, consolidation).
- Enrich configuration struct at runtime with dynamic data (e.g., BotInfo) when feasible.
- Continue maintaining clean code and removing unused components as the project evolves.

**Learnings & Project Insights**

- Consolidated error handling in batch operations significantly improves robustness and maintainability
- Statistical reporting (processed/saved counts) provides valuable operational insights
- Context timeout management is critical for AI operations which may hang indefinitely
- Partial success handling in batch operations is preferable to all-or-nothing approaches for user experience
- Factory functions for handlers create consistent initialization patterns and dependency injection
- Explicit context management with timeouts prevents resource leaks in long-running operations
- Structured logging with operation timing provides valuable diagnostic information
- Separating core system instructions (like bot capabilities) from response formatting instructions (like avoiding prefixes) in AI prompts leads to cleaner and more maintainable prompt management. Parameterizing prompts (e.g. `MentionSystemInstructionHeader`) enhances flexibility.
- Detailed guidelines and examples in `ProfileAnalyzerSystemInstruction` are crucial for consistent and high-quality AI output for user profiling.
- Regular dead code analysis is beneficial for maintaining codebase health.
