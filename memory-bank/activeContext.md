  - Added comprehensive validation for all database operations
- Security improvements:
  - Added AdminOnly middleware to protect sensitive commands
  - Implemented access control for data manipulation operations
  - Ensured proper authentication for administrative functions
- Administrative command implementation:
  - /mrl_reset command for deleting all messages and profiles atomically

  - Added consolidated error handling logic for batch operations
  - Enhanced recovery mechanism for partial AI operation failures
  - Improved logging with operation timing and result statistics
  - Added structured error reporting for both users and logs
- Gemini Prompt Refinement:
  - Updated `MentionSystemInstructionHeader` to include a capabilities list (conversational assistant, admin commands, user profile analysis, image analysis, task scheduling, database operations) and explicitly instruct the model *not* to mimic the input message format (timestamp/UID prefix) in its replies.

**Next Steps**
- Implement comprehensive unit tests to verify scheduler and mention handler
- Add integration tests for the bot orchestrator and component interactions
- Improve documentation of the new gocron scheduler implementation
- Consider implementing additional AI models beyond Gemini for comparison
- Dockerize the application and set up a CI/CD workflow
- Create helper CLI scripts for development tasks
- Enhance the testing of transaction management and atomic operations
- Consider additional middleware for rate limiting and request validation
- Improve user feedback for administrative operations
- Add telemetry for AI operation performance monitoring
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for AI service resilience
- Add comprehensive tests for the profile analysis logic
- Consider implementing pagination for large profile datasets
- Optimize message processing batch sizes for improved throughput

**Active Decisions & Considerations**
- Use built-in validators from go-playground/validator when available instead of custom implementations
- Provide sensible defaults for all configuration options while maintaining validation
- Use gocron v2 for all scheduled task management for better reliability
- Implement consistent context timeout handling across all long-running operations
- Provide detailed logging of scheduled task execution and performance
- Use standardized error handling patterns with proper error wrapping
- Ensure all components have proper shutdown procedures
- Maintain consistent terminology aligned with the Telegram API (chat_id instead of group_id)
- Use properly managed database transactions for related operations to ensure atomicity
- Provide detailed error information in logs while keeping user-facing messages simple
- Apply appropriate middleware to protect sensitive operations
- Standardize error handling patterns across all handlers
- Apply context timeouts to all AI operations with appropriate duration settings
- Implement partial success handling for batch operations rather than all-or-nothing
- Use statistical reporting for complex operations (processed/saved counts)
- Prefer explicit cancellation and timeout handling over generic error checks
- Ensure AI responses do not include the input message formatting prefixes (timestamp/UID).

**Important Patterns & Preferences**
- Configuration: Prefer built-in validators and provide sensible defaults for all options
- Scheduler Management: Use gocron v2's job API for registration and NewTask for execution
- Context Management: Propagate context through all operations with proper timeout handling
- Error Handling: Use structured logging with context and appropriate severity levels
- Component Lifecycle: Use errgroup for concurrent component management with proper shutdown
- Resource Management: Ensure all resources are properly released during shutdown
- Terminology: Use 'chat_id' consistently across code, database, and logs to match Telegram's terminology
- Transaction Management: Use defer tx.Rollback() pattern with explicit commit and nil assignment
- Middleware Application: Apply middleware in reverse order with the first in the slice being outermost
- Handler Organization: Use factory functions (newXHandler) for consistent initialization
- AI Operations: Implement context-aware timeouts with appropriate duration for profile analysis
- Batch Processing: Include detailed statistics (processed/saved counts) in logs and responses
- Error Recovery: Implement graceful degradation with partial success handling in batch operations
- Concurrency Management: Use proper timeout contexts for long-running operations with clear duration
- AI Prompting: Explicitly instruct the model on desired output formatting, including what *not* to include (e.g., input prefixes).

**Learnings & Project Insights**
- Consolidated error handling in batch operations significantly improves robustness and maintainability
- Statistical reporting (processed/saved counts) provides valuable operational insights
- Context timeout management is critical for AI operations which may hang indefinitely
- Partial success handling in batch operations is preferable to all-or-nothing approaches for user experience
- Factory functions for handlers create consistent initialization patterns and dependency injection
- Explicit context management with timeouts prevents resource leaks in long-running operations
- Structured logging with operation timing provides valuable diagnostic information
