# Progress

**What Works**
- Configuration loading and validation via Viper and go-playground/validator:
  - Improved validation using built-in validators instead of custom ones
  - Added comprehensive defaults for all configuration options
  - Updated example configuration with detailed inline documentation
  - Clear distinction between truly required fields (tokens, API keys) and those with defaults
- Structured logging implemented in `internal/logger` using Go `slog`.
- Database initialization with embedded migrations using `github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/database/sqlite3`.
- Bot setup, handlers, and scheduled tasks integration.
- Migration instantiation fixed to use `migrate.NewWithInstance` with the proper sqlite3 driver.
- Code builds and runs without import or driver errors after `go mod tidy`.
- Simplified database schema with removal of redundant fields and more intuitive naming.
- Streamlined handler code through inlining of utility functions.
- Scheduler system fully migrated from cron library to gocron v2:
  - Successfully implemented task wrapper pattern for consistent execution
  - Added proper job naming and management
  - Improved error handling and logging for scheduled tasks
  - Implemented graceful shutdown with task completion waiting
- Enhanced mention handler with robust image processing capabilities:
  - MIME type detection for proper content handling
  - Size-limited file downloads with context-aware HTTP requests
  - Timeout management for image processing operations
  - Improved error reporting with user-friendly messages
- Fixed all identified bugs from our systematic analysis:
  - Enhanced transaction management for all multi-record operations
  - Improved parameter validation across database operations
  - Added context timeout handling to prevent resource leaks
  - Fixed SQLite compatibility issues with better query patterns
  - Implemented consistent error handling and logging
  - Added parameter boundary checking and validation
- Successfully standardized terminology throughout the codebase:
  - Changed database schema from 'group_id' to 'chat_id' in migration files
  - Updated Message struct to use ChatID instead of GroupID with matching db tags
  - Modified all SQL queries to use the standardized column name
  - Updated all log messages and error reporting to use consistent terminology
  - Ensured consistent naming aligned with Telegram API conventions
- Enhanced database operations:
  - Atomic DeleteAllMessagesAndProfiles for consistent resets
  - Improved transaction management with proper rollback handling
  - Structured error reporting with context information
  - Parameter validation before executing operations
  - Row affect checking for critical operations
- Administrative commands implementation:
  - /mrl_reset command for complete data reset (messages and profiles)
  - /mrl_edit_user command for user profile management
  - /mrl_profiles command for viewing all stored profiles
  - All protected with AdminOnly middleware
- Security implementation:
  - Middleware-based protection of administrative commands
  - Proper validation of administrative request parameters
  - Clear feedback on authorization failures
- Profile analysis enhancements:
  - Context-aware timeout handling for AI operations
  - Consolidated error handling for batch operations
  - Recovery mechanisms for partial operation failures
  - Statistical reporting of operations (processed/saved counts)
  - Explicit error categorization and handling
  - Closure-based scope management for complex operations
- AI Response Formatting:
  - Updated `MentionSystemInstructionHeader` prompt to include a capabilities list (conversational assistant, admin commands, user profile analysis, image analysis, task scheduling, database operations) and prevent the AI from mimicking input message prefixes (timestamp/UID) in its replies.

**What's Left to Build**
- Unit and integration tests for the new scheduler implementation
- Comprehensive testing for the enhanced mention handler
- Integration tests for the bot orchestrator and component interactions
- Database connection pooling improvements for better scalability
- Database abstraction layer to potentially support other backends
- Documentation improvements for the new gocron scheduler
- Dockerization and CI/CD pipeline setup
- Helper CLI scripts for development tasks (seeding, resetting state, database maintenance)
- Additional test coverage for command handlers and transaction logic
- Rate limiting middleware for public endpoints
- More granular access control for different admin levels
- Update `README.md` to reflect all the recent improvements and migration
- Performance profiling and optimization for frequently accessed data
- Consider implementing additional AI models beyond Gemini for comparison
- Telemetry system for AI operation performance monitoring
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation for external service resilience
- Pagination implementation for large profile datasets
- Optimization of message batch processing for throughput

**Current Status**
- Core architecture and features are fully implemented with improved scheduler
- Configuration system refined with better validation and comprehensive defaults
- Scheduler migration to gocron v2 is complete and functioning properly
- Mention handler has been enhanced with improved image processing
- Database operations use transactions for better atomicity and consistency
- Reset functionality uses atomic operations to ensure data consistency
- Error handling has been significantly improved with better context propagation
- Context timeout handling prevents resource leaks in long-running operations
- Parameter validation is comprehensive across all operations
- Admin commands are properly protected with middleware
- Command handler registration uses a consistent pattern with proper middleware application
- All identified bugs from our systematic analysis have been fixed
- Profile analysis implementation is robust with proper error handling and recovery
- Terminology has been standardized across code and database schema for better consistency
- Configuration example updated with detailed inline documentation
- AI prompts refined to ensure cleaner output formatting.

**Known Issues**
- No comprehensive tests for the new scheduler implementation yet
- Need to verify the robustness of the mention handler under high load
- Potential for optimization in database query patterns and connection pooling
- Need to implement consistent error handling patterns across all handlers
- Potential for optimization in database transaction patterns
- Could improve the user feedback for administrative operations
- No comprehensive testing strategy for middleware yet
- Documentation needs to be updated to reflect the scheduler migration
- AI analysis operations may timeout under high load or complex profiles
- Need better telemetry for long-running AI operations
- Large message batches may cause performance issues during analysis
- ~~AI model sometimes mimics input message format (timestamp/UID prefix) in replies.~~ (Resolved by prompt update)

**Evolution of Decisions**
- Moved from custom validators to built-in validators where possible for simplicity and maintainability
- Adopted approach of providing sensible defaults for all configuration options
- Migrated from cron library to gocron v2 for improved task management
- Enhanced the mention handler with better image processing capabilities
- Improved component lifecycle management with proper shutdown procedures
- Continued emphasis on modular, interface-driven design and embedded resources
- Adopted consistent transaction management patterns for database operations
- Implemented standardized context handling with proper timeout management
- Developed comprehensive parameter validation approach for all operations
- Standardized on Telegram API terminology (chat_id rather than group_id) for better consistency
- Implemented atomic operations for related database changes (like reset functionality)
- Added AdminOnly middleware to protect sensitive commands
- Standardized command handler registration with middleware support
- Moved toward consistent factory functions for handler initialization
- Implemented partial success handling for batch operations rather than all-or-nothing approach
- Added statistical reporting (processed/saved counts) to batch operations
- Introduced dedicated timeout contexts for long-running AI operations
- Refined AI prompts to explicitly guide output formatting and prevent unwanted mimicry of input structure.
