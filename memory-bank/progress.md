  - Proper validation of administrative request parameters
  - Clear feedback on authorization failures
- Profile analysis enhancements:
  - Context-aware timeout handling for AI operations
  - Consolidated error handling for batch operations

  - Statistical reporting of operations (processed/saved counts)
  - Explicit error categorization and handling
  - Closure-based scope management for complex operations
- AI Response Formatting:
  - Updated `MentionSystemInstructionHeader` prompt to include a capabilities list, accept bot name/username parameters, and prevent the AI from mimicking input message prefixes (timestamp/UID) in its replies.
  - `ProfileAnalyzerSystemInstruction` updated with detailed guidelines for preserving existing profile data, and specific quality requirements for traits (brevity, max 15-20 traits, no redundancy, aggressive consolidation, prioritization of personality traits, use of simple terms, avoidance of weak observations), including examples.
- Runtime bot information retrieval (`GetMe`) and storage in config.
- Core bot functionality (message handling, AI replies, image analysis, user profiling).
- Database operations (storing/retrieving messages, users, profiles).
- Scheduled tasks (SQL maintenance at 3 AM, automated profile analysis at 2 AM).
- Configuration loading and logging.
- Telegram API integration.
- AI integration with Gemini.
- Database migrations.

**What's Left to Build**

- Unit Tests: Scheduler, mention handler, transaction logic, middleware, profile analysis logic.
- Integration Tests: Bot orchestrator, component interactions.
- Documentation: Update `README.md` and internal docs for scheduler migration, new features.
- CI/CD: Set up GitHub Actions for build, test, release, Docker builds (partially defined in README).
- Dev Tools: Helper CLI scripts (seeding, reset, maintenance).
- Scalability/Resilience: DB connection pooling, circuit breaker for AI, pagination for profiles, batch size optimization.
- User Experience: Improved feedback for admin commands.
- Monitoring: Telemetry for AI operations.
- Exploration: Consider alternative AI models, database abstraction layer.

**Current Status**

- Core architecture and features are fully implemented with improved scheduler
- Automated profile analysis now runs daily via scheduled tasks instead of manual commands
- Configuration system refined with better validation and comprehensive defaults
- Scheduler migration to gocron v2 is complete and functioning properly
- Mention handler has been enhanced with improved image processing
- Database operations use transactions for better atomicity and consistency
- Reset functionality uses atomic operations to ensure data consistency
- Error handling has been significantly improved with better context propagation
- Context timeout handling prevents resource leaks in long-running operations
- Parameter validation is comprehensive across all operations
- Admin commands are properly protected with middleware
- Command handler registration uses a consistent pattern with proper middleware application
- All identified bugs from our systematic analysis have been fixed
- Profile analysis implementation is robust with proper error handling and recovery
- Terminology has been standardized across code and database schema for better consistency
- Configuration example updated with detailed inline documentation
- AI prompts refined to ensure cleaner output formatting.
- Runtime bot information is successfully retrieved and stored.
- Completed a full codebase review for dead/obsolete code.
- Removed identified deprecated database methods from `internal/database/store.go`.
- Confirmed no other dead code in the Go source files.
- The project is stable and current tasks are complete.

**Known Issues**

- **Testing Gaps:** Lack of comprehensive unit/integration tests for:
  - Scheduler logic and task execution.
  - Mention handler robustness (especially under load).
  - Database transaction atomicity and edge cases.
  - Middleware functionality (e.g., AdminOnly).
  - Profile analysis logic (`analyze_handler.go`).
- Potential performance bottlenecks:
  - Database query patterns under load.
  - Large message batches during profile analysis.
  - AI analysis operations timing out under load.
- User feedback for admin operations could be more informative.
- Documentation (README, etc.) needs updates for recent changes.
- Lack of telemetry for AI operations.

**Evolution of Decisions**

- Moved from custom validators to built-in validators where possible for simplicity and maintainability
- Adopted approach of providing sensible defaults for all configuration options
- Migrated from cron library to gocron v2 for improved task management
- Enhanced the mention handler with better image processing capabilities
- Improved component lifecycle management with proper shutdown procedures
- Continued emphasis on modular, interface-driven design and embedded resources
- Adopted consistent transaction management patterns for database operations
- Implemented standardized context handling with proper timeout management
- Developed comprehensive parameter validation approach for all operations
- Standardized on Telegram API terminology (chat_id rather than group_id) for better consistency
- Implemented atomic operations for related database changes (like reset functionality)
- Added AdminOnly middleware to protect sensitive commands
- Standardized command handler registration with middleware support
- Moved toward consistent factory functions for handler initialization
- Implemented partial success handling for batch operations rather than all-or-nothing approach
- Added statistical reporting (processed/saved counts) to batch operations
- Introduced dedicated timeout contexts for long-running AI operations
- Refined AI prompts to explicitly guide output formatting and prevent unwanted mimicry of input structure. `MentionSystemInstructionHeader` is now parameterized. `ProfileAnalyzerSystemInstruction` has strict guidelines for content generation, especially regarding trait quality and preservation of existing data.
- Decided to enrich configuration at runtime with data fetched after initialization (e.g., BotInfo via `GetMe`).
- Decision to perform a full dead code audit has been completed, leading to a cleaner `store.go`.
- Reinforced the practice of ensuring all code components have clear usage.
